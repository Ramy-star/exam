/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for GitGrind application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a hybrid security model. It enforces strict user-ownership for private user data under /users/{userId},
 * while allowing public read access to top-level collections like /lectures and /mcqs.  Write access to /examResults
 * is restricted to authorized users and validated to ensure data integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /lectures/{lectureId}: Stores lecture content. Publicly readable.
 * - /mcqs/{mcqId}: Stores multiple-choice questions. Publicly readable.
 * - /writtenQuestions/{writtenQuestionId}: Stores written questions. Publicly readable.
 * - /examResults/{resultId}: Stores exam results. Publicly readable, but create must validate the `userId` field.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted to lectures and questions to facilitate open access to learning materials.
 * - The rules strictly enforce that a user can only create exam results with their own user ID.
 * - Exam results can be read by all users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'ExamResult' entity requires the `userId` field to exist so that the user ID can be checked on write operations.
