/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for GitGrind application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data protection and enforces strict ownership for user-specific data. It balances open access for shared resources (lectures, questions) with controlled access to user-specific data and exam results.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /lectures/{lectureId}: Stores publicly readable lecture content. Write access is not defined in this prototype, assumed to be managed externally (e.g., by a separate admin tool).
 * - /mcqs/{mcqId}: Stores publicly readable MCQ content. Write access is not defined in this prototype, assumed to be managed externally.
 * - /writtenQuestions/{writtenQuestionId}: Stores publicly readable written question content. Write access is not defined in this prototype, assumed to be managed externally.
 * - /examResults/{resultId}: Stores exam results. Write access is restricted to authenticated users, with userId denormalized onto the document, and must match the authenticated user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted for lectures and questions to simplify content delivery.
 * - Exam results are readable by all to allow for the generation of comparative statistics but writing to it is controlled to ensure data integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Exam results include a `userId` field, denormalized for simplified security rules and faster queries.
